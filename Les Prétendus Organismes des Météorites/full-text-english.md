Towards the end of 1880 there appeared in Germany a work in _quarto_, which could not fail to arouse one's attention. It was entitled: _The Meteorite (Chondrite) and its Organisms_, presented and described by Dr. Otto Hahn. Thirty-two tables with a hundred and forty-two pictures photographed. Tübingen, 1880. Laupp, publisher.

I summarize, by literally translating the author's words, the main results he lays down.

"The chondrites, an olivine-feldspar (enstatite) rock, consist of an animal world, they are not part of a sedimentary rock layer nor a conglomerate, but a felt of animals, a fabric whose meshes were all once living beings and life of the lowest kind, the beginnings of creation." (p. 3.)

"As one examines the tables of this work, it immediately becomes clear that these are not mineral forms, but organic ones; that we have before us the images of life, images of life of the lowest order, a creation which in greater part finds some of its closest relatives here on Earth — regarding the corals and crinoids, this is determined with absolute certainty; however, the sponges have only a little similarity with those forms of the terrestrial genera." (p. 7.)

"Anyone who even superficially surveys the forms will soon find that they provide an actual historical development. All the transitions from the sponge to the coral, from the coral to the crinoid are present, so that it becomes doubtful if one should assign new species to these transitions." (p. 3.)

"The investigations up till now, in the whole field, with the exception of [Karl Wilhelm von] Gümbel's work in the Munich Academy, are of little use, both regarding the accuracy of their observations and even more the interpretations based upon those observations, i.e. on unproven hypotheses and weak assumptions — not suitable for scientific findings as such." (p. 7.)

Hahn therefore believes that he has provided "incontestable proof that the chondrites are the remains of animals that lived in water, that the entire meteorite is formed only of the remains of sponges, corals, and crinoids, metamorphosed by petrification into enstatite. It is true, he says, that there are small rare places where there are real crystals, but these crystals are so disposed that they cannot have any influence on the value of my actual proofs." (p. 21.)

"When I said that the chondrite is nothing but an animal-fabric, an animal-felt, a qualification must be sustained."

"There are, however, very small, sharply outlined places in this animal-bone stone, which could probably (but not necessarily) be from the beginning rocks. These are slate-blue, uncommon inclusions with 3-5 mm. diameters _lacking definite recurring forms_, which include distinct crystals in their grayish mass, these are on average either squares or rhombuses, at other times it includes hexagons. This mineral can be either augite or olivine. It does not knock on the fact, _that in the olivine strata formations exist and that these are the cause of the construction of the planet bodies, their self-constructed development and complex composition_."

"In all cases, however, the ratio in the chondritic rock is the opposite as that in the sedimentary layers of Earth. In the latter the organisms are stored and the rock strata enclose them; in the first there are only organisms and the rock strata are masses of such." (p. 35.)

"These forms are not mineral forms," says Mr. Hahn with absolute certainty. But knowing very well that similar such assertions are rarely accepted by the scientific world, without palpable proofs, he seeks to give them by grouping them into two categories, stating positive proofs and negative proofs.

"In order to prove that a plant or animal organism is present, I consider it necessary to prove:  
1. a determinate form, (I do not know how to translate the term used several times by Mr. Hahn, "geschlossene Form"; the literal translation, "closed form" has no meaning)  
2. a form that repeats,  
3. one which repeats itself in degrees of development,  
4. structure, namely cells or vessels,  
5. resemblance to known forms."  

"If these requirements are valid, it remains only to decide whether plant or animal? Now ask yourself, do my forms fulfill these requirements?" (p. 20.)

Needless to say, the response is affirmative.

Of all these conditions laid out by Mr. Hahn, there are obviously only two that can decide the question from certain points of view; the others are equally applicable to minerals. Crystals have determinate forms, which always repeat themselves and always better than organic forms, in the various phases of development. Until now we were quite convinced that it was a privilege of the great number of organic types to change form during the different phases of their development; apart from spawn, germs and seeds, and larval forms, for example, which are often very different from those of definitive animals, and the cotyledons of plants, which often do not resemble definitive leaves in any way, crystal forms are extremely stable. Mr. Hahn maintains that we are in error. Granted, – only, in this case, the first three conditions he poses do not say anything about the distinction between organic and inorganic forms.

The structure that Mr. Hahn invokes as the fourth condition is without a doubt preponderant, provided however that the animal or plant parts subject to the petrification persist. Hahn poses as a condition of this structure the presence of cells or vessels. That's very well, – but I'd like to know, what cells and vessels could remain when a sponge undergoes fossilization? It is known that the tissues of these animals are composed of extremely delicate cells, which dissolve with great ease, and all that can be found in a petrified sponge consists of calcareous or siliceous mineral spicules, in which neither cells nor vessels can be seen! And if the presence of cells or vessels is an indispensable feature, what is to become of fossil corals, where one definitely sees only lacuna surrounded by crystals?

All that remains of the five conditions posed by Mr. Hahn is that last, the similarity with known forms. But here again the greatest uncertainties can take place. Are these the exterior forms? Are these the details of the structure of the forms? We mention, in another essay, a host of cases where prominent mineral conformations, produced artificially or by nature, mimic in a perfect manner organic forms and we have, on the other hand, in the corals, in the intracellular crystals of plants, in the otoliths of animals, a quantity of examples of mineral forms produced by organisms.

We must therefore address the forms and special comparative structures. We must push the comparison to the most minor details in appearance when we want to prove that this object which we have before our eyes is a sponge, a coral, or a crinoid. We leave aside, for the moment, the so-called negative proofs by which the author wants to demonstrate to us that the objects displayed by him cannot be mineral forms – they are of about the same value as his positive proofs. We address the special forms, which by their resemblance to known forms and by their identical structure have to provide incontestable proof that the chondrites are formed by organisms related to those of the Earth.

We sequentially give a review on these claimed organisms by enumerating, with the same terms of the work, the aspects that the author attributes to different organisms which he believes to have recognized. 

##### "A. Sponges"

"1\. _Urania_"

"Round, lobed bodies with an obvious place of growth." – "Folds caused by contraction." – "Circumvented spiral." – "The structure consists of an outer membrane enclosing lamellar layers." – "Blue color." – "Obvious stratification. One might attempt to place the form among the corals if the outer form did not exist." – "We believe to see the indication of a mouth opening."

"After all this, I think _Urania_ is a sessile sponge that contracts in a spiral form, absorbing and expelling water like our living sponges." (p. 23 and 24.)

These are the structural details that must convert us to the opinion of Mr. Hahn. The _Urania_ fill, according to him, three twentieths of the total mass of the stony meteorites; they are displayed on six tables comprising thirty-one figures.

In a previous work by the same author, _Primordial Cell_, _Urania guilielmi_, dedicated to Emperor William [I], was represented as a plant with rounded leaves, wrapped up in its young age and equipped with capsules carrying spores. In passing through the present work, _Urania_ lost these capsules with their spores; it became a sponge. It is true that we are not allowed to learn of the point causing this change of place, so considerable, to occur; the author does not say a word about the reasons which obliged him to change his opinion. What aspects of this supposed organism were lost or gained to be transported from one kingdom to another? An inopportune question that the author does not answer.

"2\. Sponges with spicules." (Table 7.)

"I place Figure 1 among the _Astrospongia_. The spicules are regularly crossed. Figure 6 is an irregular spicule framework with a weakly indicated cavity." (p. 24.)

The supposed spicules resemble, mistakenly, linear crystals dispersed in a homogeneous mass, such as seen in the initial coming of lava. In a few places we see a slightly marked tendency towards a stellar arrangement, very common in crystals, unusual in the spicules of sponges, whose forms are known to be quite different (1).

The author could not have compared his _Urania_ and astro-sponges with living and fossil sponges; he could not have studied the structure of the latter, for it would be impossible with this acquired knowledge to convince connoisseurs, as the notions and figures given by him have little rapport with the microscopic structure and nature of sponges. Mr. Hahn must be entirely ignorant of the fine research of Mr. Zittel on fossil sponges. (_Memoirs of the Munich Academy_, Vol. 12 and 13; _Handbook of Paleontology_, Vol. 1), because with this knowledge he could not have presented to us, as obvious sponges, cross-sections with rounded contours surrounded by a membrane [sic!] possessing a structure or fine striations or lamella, equally unknown in living and fossil sponges. We know, it is true, of a quantity of fossil sponges where the layout of the channels displays a radiating arrangement, already visible to the naked eye or the magnifying glass (_Aulocopium_, the Ventriculitides); but in all these sponges the spicules, being either loose or forming a very regular reticulated skeletal mesh, are always recognizable in the magnifications used by Mr. Hahn. In the claimed sponges of the meteorites there does not exist any trace whatsoever of this characteristic skeleton. We also know from Mr. Zittel's research the conditions under which, by the pseudomorphosis of siliceous sponges in limestone and that of calcareous sponges in silica, the inner structure may be entirely or partly lost; but in these cases the indication of the channels equally disappears and there remain only amorphous masses without apparent structure, formerly called "petrosponges" but which have been entirely removed from this classification ever since Mr. Zittel made known their true primitive structure.

Conclusions: The claimed sponges of the meteorites have neither the form nor the structure of known sponges.

##### "B. Corals"

"Here we have such well-preserved terrestrial forms that not a doubt is left remaining."

"Table 8 shows a sample image, Table 9 its channel structure: obvious bud channels that are tubular connections (for there are such). In addition, there is the curvature of the channels, which absolutely cannot be mistaken for a sheet breakage, plus there is the very clear tube openings and finally an equally clear growth site. The bud channels are 0.003 mm apart. Of course, everything you can ask for from a _Favosites_ structure."

"In Table 11 any researcher will easily recognize the image of living coral forms, the more so as the cup shape (cavity) is indicated in Figure 1 above. The same object also shows the cross partitions of the tubes, which clearly emerge." (Unfortunately, I fail to see in this figure any indication of a cavity, tubes, or transverse partitions.)

In other figures: "Obvious lamellar structure."

In others: "Tubular corals obvious. In the original, one can clearly distinguish: glassy like intermediate masses, black tube walls, yellow tubular filling material, occasionally the latter is also black. This form occurs a hundredfold in all the chondrites." (pages 25 and 26.)

Corals constitute, according to the author, one twentieth of the total mass.

By attentively studying the thirty figures of the so-called corals, distributed on nine tables, we can be convinced from the outset that all the figures representing entire specimens show absolutely the same general form as the _Uranias_, – a rounded form with well developed contours, similar to that of an entire round or oval leaf. The only difference that exists between the claimed sponges and the claimed corals is in the appearance of divergent ridges which eccentrically set themselves out from a narrow point of departure and which seem thicker and better marked in the corals. It is as one sees in the general form of the chondrules, – most of the figures give us absolutely nothing more than what we have known for a long time from the authors occupied by the meteorites. We come across, it is true, a few rare figures showing radiant streaks from several points of departure. Mr. Gümbel has already mentioned this exceptional disposition that I have also noticed in many of my cuts; we see another, designated by the name "chain coral", where on a clear rounded space there are present some obscure spots with washed-out and irregularly arranged contours. This figure resembles, as much and perhaps more, the skin of a speckled cat over that of a coral. But the author wants it to be a coral; may your will be done, my lord!

The structure stands out above all in the two figures photographed under high magnification, Table 9 and Table 15. On the first, one sees columns with straight fixed contours, occasionally a little curved; a few of these columns show a series of dark dots aligned in the center. These dots can be seen on a few columns of the fifteenth table, but this magnified figure at once gives the explanation of the phenomenon, which, according to Mr. Hahn, provides proof for the existence of an axial channel in the center of the columns. In fact, we see a small column chipped at nearly regular intervals on one of the sides and cracked transversely into several pieces, thus resembling a gear shaft. Fractures in the breaks are filled with a black encrusting material. Imagine the figure of a battered and worn bevel gear shaft, on its surface erosion has carried to the bottom of hollows a substance and we will have the image of a small column marked with points aligned along the axis, such as the figure of Mr. Hahn.

If it is already now astonishing, that among these numerous figures, compared sometimes to the _Favosites_ of the Silurian, at other times to crateriform, star or even chain corals, _there is not one to be found that displays a general form different from the claimed Uranias_, our astonishment increases even more if we compare the structures (not described, because Mr. Hahn does not give descriptions, but depicted) to those which we know of living corals or well-characterized fossils. Very reckless indeed, one who would like to find in the figures of Mr. Hahn something analogous to the figure that we give of a piece of a section of a branch of _Syringopora caliendrum_ (Ehrenberg), which has been oblingingly borrowed from our colleague Mr. Th. Studer, professor in Bern, and which gives the ideal section of star corals, stony corals [Scleractinia], maze corals, _Fungia_, _Tubipora_ and _Favosites_ in our possession because it summarizes, essentially, the modifications of structure that can be found among other corals. This section ([Fig. 1](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/KarlVogt/Fig1.png)) indeed shows a branch of coral cut longitudinally. The section traverses broad areas encompassed by a thicker skeleton and fine tips, faded down to the most complete transparency.

"The microscopic structure of stony coral [Scleractinia] skeletons", says Mr. Zittel (_Palaeontology_, p. 206), "is very uniformly fibro-crystalline. The small fibers that outwardly radiate from the centers of crystallization form star-like patterns, similar to feathers."

The skeleton of Anthozoan polyparies displays, as a matter of fact, a microscopic structure that, in the majority of cases, is plainly crystalline. A tube or a branch of coral is not simply a piece of solid limestone, pierced along its axis by a roundish central channel or divided by partitions, like Mr. Hahn presents; the branch is always composed of a multitude of tiny crystalline pieces, assembled in a specific order. In transverse cuttings of the channels or cells of the _Favosites_ and _Tubipora_, we see the tops of these parts protruding inward; in longitudinal cuts, they seem arranged like the barbs of a feather. The bud of a channel (our figure displays one), even if it was one-tenth of a millimeter thick, will still show this composite structure for the simple reason that the skeleton is primarily comprised of crystalline spicules isolated from one another, which are brought together only later. These scattered spicules can be seen with ease in the cortical layer of the Gorgonacea and within the fleshy mass of Octocorallia. In the polypary's fan parts, in the feeding lamellae, in the septa frequently very fine, these crystalline pieces collect into stars, occasionally simulating through their forms osseous corpuscles or even exhibit a reticulated aspect, yet in which the small parts are just recognizable under a strong magnification. We provide a figure ([Figure 1a](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/KarlVogt/Fig1.png)) of this reticulated structure under a magnification of 500 diameters. This structure does not disappear at all, unless a petrifying crystallization has filled it entirely, even skeletal spaces; we may also observe about the thinnest sections, that they appear much better than the sections only a little bit thicker; it is seen, regarding the latter, in the ever so thin partitions of the _Favosites_.

Yet, this structure so characteristic with its crystalline elements of multi-faceted form, but constant in every specie, is completely lacking in the claimed corals of Mr. Hahn, shots of chondrules. We posses before our eyes a thin section with chondrules, which represent this author's corals; the object is composed of rods or small solid columns, radiating from an eccentric center (attachment point for Mr. Hahn), occassionally dichotomized at very acute angles, separated from one another by an opaque incrusting mass, which has infiltrated the transverse fractures or superficial chips, thereby simulating a longitudinal series of pits and grooves.

There is therefore not a single similarity between the claimed corals of Mr. Hahn and genuine corals, such as we know them from the various formations in the most ancient strata of the Earth. There is not even a similitude with the external forms, because the tubiform cells of _Favosites_ are distinctly polygonal and pierced by holes on their wall, and the entire polyp is either loosely branched or very organized in a thick mass. 

We arrive at the final class, representing, according to Mr. Hahn, most of the chondrules of the meteorites and that themselves make up, according to the author, sixteen-twenthieths of the total mass. It is the class or even, if you will, the phylum of Echinoderms, represented by the crinoids. Studied with preference by our author, this type did not provide fewer than sixty-six figures. Here, we will undoubtedly come across a more ample yield of facts and observations. The structure of the crinoids is complicated; their forms are quite varied; study offers plenty of difficulties, on which the sagacity of the observer can be applied. Given the multitude of specimens found within the meteorite of Knyahinya alone, the bottom of the planetary sea, from which the aerolites originate, must have resembled a submarine crinoid forest, an occurrence known from the dredging of modern expeditions.

##### "C. Crinoids"

"They are found from the most simple form of an articulated arm to complete crinoids with stem (we have searched in vain for a stem in the figures), with calyx, main and auxiliary arms. The conservation is ordinarily good. The difficulty comes with the thousands of directions of the cut that always result in different images of the same object. The oviform remains, which were considered to be glass, are calyxes of crinoids." – "Arms broken by pressure from above." – "Crinoids with as many arms as one likes" (Mit einer beliebigen Anzahl von Armen). – "Crinoid with five arms." – "Reticulated structure upon a few forms, which agrees with the structure of schreibersite in the meteoritic irons." – "Different incertain forms; we are not sure if they are sponges, _Urania_ or corals." – "Reminds one of the genus _Comatula_."

I believe that I have omitted nothing in my report of the observations on the forms and structures. The rest must be guessed from the figures.

We admit that it is very meager. A few assertions without any proof.

As I already hinted in my talk about the facts of the sponges and corals, the author does not present any comparison, even superficial, with the structure of other living or fossil organisms belonging to the same class. Mr. Hahn contents himself with the most crude resemblance. As a matter of fact, the objects in the figures resemble crinoids like a leaf of the _Sabal_ or _Chamaerops_ resembles a fan. That is all.

We could speak at length if we wanted to get into an itemized critique of the numerous figures photographed by the author. So, for all the figures of Table 29, this is how they will be taken by all observers who have been occupied by research on thin sections of rocks: as assemblages of more or less acicular crystals, assembled in the highly common form of asterisks grouped around different centers, such as we are used to seeing, for example, in the actinoliths. The majority of the figures in the following plate will not contradict this diagnosis. The other figures, such as those of Tables 17 and 28, do not display any resemblance, neither remote nor rough, with a part or section of a crinoid; as for the other figures, that is to say (Table 19), cuts of large poorly defined crystals with worn out corners and traversed by channeled breaks in all directions, they are boldly granted to us as the panels of the calyx of a crinoid, whose arms resolve themselves immediately, without transition, into a mass of secondary rays.

We may apply to all these claimed crinoids the same remarks we have already made about the corals. _All of them, as they are a whole, possess precisely the same form in rounded sheets, like the corals, like the Uranias._ We could copy exactly the contours of the _Urania_ sponge and apply them to a coral, to a crinoid, without having the need for the slightest alteration. We present a figure of a Hahnian crinoid ([Fig. 2](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/KarlVogt/Fig2.png)), drawn from a distinct chamber in a thin section of the Vouillé meteorite, which Mr. Daubrée has permitted us to use with his habitual helpfulness. This figure is even more complete than any of the figures photographed in such large numbers by Mr. Hahn, – were we observe exactly the same rounded leaf form. However, admittedly, we are not in any way certain if our determination is right, – is it an _Urania_, a coral, a crinoid? We willingly leave the choice to the reader, – what we are certain of, in any event, is that this is a section of a complete chondrule, within which are embedded fragments of meteoritic iron in places. 

Surely, none of the figures produced by Mr. Hahn correspond with the exterior likeness of crinoids, as we know them. Does the general order of the body correspond better? One is permitted to be in doubt. Except in a single case, none of these meteoritic crinoids obey the general law, which establishes the number of five branches for animals of this class. Just a few rare cystoids present exceptions to this rule in that they have a number of reduced arms always not very developed, simple, without branchings, so barely apparent that their existence was denied for a long time. With the crinoids of Knyahinya, on the contrary, what a plush growth of arms, branched to excess, in number as considerable as one wishes! The few genuine crinoid fossils with six arms (_Hexacrinus_, _Atocrinus_) are so rare, so similar to adjacent genera, that the majority of authors deem them as monstrosities. But they may not be compared in any way with those Briareus who fell to Earth and who were likely premature, for they came into overt rebellion against the law established for the terrestrial creations.  

The general form leaves us with shortcomings, the order of the parts of the body eludes us, – we are thus required to secure the inner, microscopic structure of these beings, devoid of stems and calyxes, and supplied with an infinite number of arms overly branched, which, above all, are not arms and would have been very awkward, according to all appearances, for accommodating the organs necessary for life, that is, if they had been alive.   

The microscopic structure of the calcareous parts of echinoderm skeletons is easy to identify. It is a consistent fact that all of these parts, whatever they are, plates, pieces of stems, arms, cirri, or pinnules, always possess a reticulated structure, with tight lattices more or less perforated, structure which manifests itself as early as the formation of the skeleton in the juveniles and maintains itself up into adult age. All these parts of the skeleton are built upon the same fundamental type, for they are formed through the meeting of sharp-edged constituent elements, primitively isolated from each other, but which are bound through their prominences. The lattice may be looser or tighter, but it is never lacking, even in the more solid parts of the skeleton.

As an example of this structure, I provide a figure of the _Pentacrinus europaeus_ (Fig. 3), the well-known larva of the comatulid, drawn according to nature and under low magnification. One observes this reticulated lattice structure on the stem, comprised of jointed cylinders, on the principal and axillary plates of the calyx, and even on barely developed arms. I need only to mention the descriptions and figures given by Mr. Carpenter (_Embryogeny of the Antedon (Comatula)_) and those of the ever erstwhile Mr. Valentin (_Monographies of the Echinoderms Living and Fossil by Agassiz_. Neuchâtel 1838-45. Echinus). Mr. Zittel outlines this structure very nicely in his _Paleontology_ (Vol. 1, p. 311-315). This author mentions, while speaking about fossil crinoids: "They almost always show an essentially crystalline conformation, due to the infiltration of calcareous spar, but rarely does it destroy the microscopic reticulated structure in a complete way. In contrast, this is lost when the limestone is replaced by silica."

Yet, nothing, absolutely nothing of this structure shows up in the figures of Mr. Hahn. What he likes to refer to under the title of "reticulated structure" (Tab. 30, Fig. 6; Tab. 21, Fig. 5) does not in any way look like the lattice structure of echinoderm parts, but instead like super small crystals, cut obliquely and arranged in tiers. Mr. Hahn thinks he has found a "remarkable" resemblance with the schreibersite of meteoritic irons that might, with help from the imagination, morph into an organism. However, neither the arms of any of these claimed crinoids, nor, above all, the colossal plates making up the so-called calyx of one of these crinoids, figured in Table 19 and which are nothing else other than a crystal traversed by breaks filled in with an opaque substance, display any trace of the characteristic structure of crinoid skeletal parts.

I frankly confess that this absolute absence of comparative investigation regarding the identified animals, living or fossil, and this complete absence of the known properties of microscopic structure, such as can be found in types of highly organized skeletal parts like the echinoderms, inspired in me the foremost doubt about the validity of the conclusions that Mr. Hahn drew from his laborious observations.

It appears that one of Mr. Hahn's defenders, his friend Mr. Weinland, a zoologist, has completely abandoned the "so-called crinoids" of his friend "since he is not able to follow the zoological determinations everywhere" (_Das Ausland_, N. 26, 1881).

I was talking of my doubts. They were compounded when I discovered, permit me to mention it, the flippancy with which Mr. Hahn moved his organisms, not only from one class, but even from one organic kingdom to another. An object, which appeared to him as a coral at the moment when he was arranging his plates, became, during the writing of the text, a crinoid or sponge, as if there were not an abyss between those different types, as if their structure were not, as we have demonstrated, fundamentally different. The _Urania_, a plant close to the _Florideae_, which possess reproductive organs drawn and described in a previous publication (_Primordial Cell_), with all of a single stroke have lost their organs and suddenly become sponges. If, in his response to Mr. Rzehak's critiques (_Das Ausland_, No. 20), Mr. Weinland excuses his friend by saying "that at the beginning of our century most proficient pundits still took sponges for plants," then it seems to us that this excuse is worst than the error, because a contemporary author should not revert to the mistakes committed eighty years ago! Another author would have sensed the necessity, vis-à-vis a scientific audience, to lay out the reasons that led him to modify his assessment, whether these reasons consisted of newly discovered details of the structure, of comparative studies performed on algae and sponges, etc. Here, nothing of the like, _sic volo, sic jubeo, stat pro ratione voluntas!_

I am wrong. Mr. Hahn formulates these transpositions, in one of the most unusual chapters that has been written in our time, such that we do not know what to admire most: the complete ignorance of the author with the laws of evolution or the audacity with which he states his views – in terms worthy of the oracle of Delphi. In effect, our author demonstrates "the unitary type of all the meteoritic organisms." Sponges, corals, crinoids are of a unified type! The forms develop one from another. I quote verbatim: "It is certain that _Urania_ is the simplest form. But, this form is the starting point for the others."

"The semicircular flap subdivides into layers, the layers into tubes, the tubes themselves are cross partitioned. The arms maintain their form, reuniting through a channel. A calyx forms between the arms and the stalk's attachment point and the simplest crinoid is there!" Really, it is seriously as simple as that!

There is, however, an element of truth within that singular statement. All the organisms of Mr. Hahn proceed in effect from a similar type, however it is far from being organic. I will return to this subject, demonstrating that the term "organic structure", which Mr. Hahn and his friends have truly abused through usage, is a term entirely meaningless when employed in general and applied to all the forms without exception and that it can only be employed by applying it to a determined and known object. One can say: such a structure is identical to this one from the sponges, from the corals, from the crinoids, consequently it is organic: one may not say: such an object has an organic or inorganic structure, because from one aspect the bodies created by the organisms, like the polypiers of the corals, are not composed of anything but crystals and from another aspect absolutely inorganic bodies may lead to forms impossible to distinguish from organic formations.

And, I as have come to show, the claimed organisms of Mr. Hahn are not in any way the structure of the animals to which he connects them; so we may say that the positive proof is not provided.

With a lack of positive proofs, Mr. Hahn sought to accumulate a certain number of so-called negative proofs, which may be summarized in the following manner: the forms that I have described and displayed cannot originate from inorganic bodies, thus they are organic.

We are not going to follow in pursuit of Mr. Hahn in these generalizations which, as we have just said, are in themselves meaningless; we will investigate the details, by studying the facts provided by observation, in order to arrive afterwards at general conclusions.

Mr. Hahn examined nineteen meteorites. It is that of Knyahinya (June 9, 1866) that supplied the greater part of his material. His collection of 360 thin sections must be, if we are to believe Mr. Weinland, the most magnificent collection in the world. We will gladly trust him. Save a few exceptions, which give no new type from the rest, all the figures of the publication in question represent claimed organisms of Knyahinya. A sole fragment of that fall has provided this multitude of forms, which Mr. Hahn estimates at several hundred. It is with much delight, no doubt, that in a single stone so many forms can be found combined together. We otherwise terrestrial paleontologists are not so fortunate.

The analysis method, followed by Mr. Hahn and his friends, is still the same very well-known for a long time; thin sections are made and observed with a microscope.

"I deliberately made," says Mr. Hahn, "the cuts in three thicknesses; not very translucent, in order to have the included bodies as complete as possible; very thin, in order to see the structure clearly; the majority of it in such a way that both views were obtained."

"I add here a remark, which will be confirmed by everyone who has dealt with thin sections of petrifaction."

"It is only in rare cases that the structure remains visible on sections perfectly transparent and consequently very thin. The observer with a microscope is in the supreme degree delighted by the beautiful forms and lines which one sees in the semi-transparent section. In joy, one will wish to do even better and expects, continuing to grind their section, to see a perfect image. But when one puts the section under the microscope for the second time, nothing is seen but an almost structureless area, with forms barely showing, uncertain in their contours, which no longer allow one to recognize under the microscope that which was seen a moment before under the magnifying glass. However, this phenomenon is in connection with the metamorphosis of rocks and the forms that are included in them. The matter is moreover well-known and does not need more special details." (pg. 16 and 17)

I confess that my experience comes to the contrary conclusion. On the semi-transparent sections I only see confusing things and it is on very thin and very transparent sections that I see the details of the structure. I will revisit this subject in the remaining part.

In my investigations, enterprises with the aim of convincing myself of the existence of organisms in the meteorites, I necessarily had to apply myself to the chondrites and especially the chondrules themselves, which form the greatest portion of them. For Mr. Hahn the chondrites are, as we have said, a "felt of organisms" and crystals constitute rare exceptions. Mr. Weinland does not go so far. "The various chondrites", he said, "are very unequal in their organic conformations; some of which are composed of two thirds or more of them." And the third third of the mass? I suspect that the two friends will agree on this third, organic for the one, obviousy inorganic for the other. It is a detail of appreciation, no doubt; but since it applies to the very objects prepared by Mr. Hahn and that Mr. Weinland has at his disposition, it is important. What happens to Mr. Hahn's negative proofs in the face of this third, according to which the forms of this third are not allowed to be inorganic?

Consequently, it was necessary to address the chondrules. While going through the publications, I saw with astonishment, that despite the opinion of Mr. Hahn, mentioned above, the structure of these bodies had already been fully identified by Gustave Rose, who provided them their name (_On the Constitution of the Meteorites_, 1862), by Mr. Daubrée (_Comptes Rendus_, 1866), by Mr. Tschermak (via his numerous communications with the Academy of Vienna), and by so many others; that Mr. Gümbel had made a comprehensive summary of this knowledge base (_Academy of Munich Bulletin_, 1878), incidentally cited with praise by Mr. Hahn, and that Messrs. Makowski and Tschermak had finally completed these details by way of the meteorite of Tieschitz (_Mémoires of the Academy of Vienna_, 1878). The figures by Mr. Gümbel, although very accurate, are in effect insufficient, being drawn under a magnification far too weak, while those provided by Messrs. Makowski and Tschermak show the exterior forms and the radiating structure of the chondrules, as well as the details of the inclusions and incrustations. I give here the description made by Mr. Gümbel in order to avoid restating the results of matters which are well-known.

"All the chondrites are without doubt rock debris, composed of small or large mineral splinters, from the well-known chondrules, almost always perfectly preserved, but often also as broken pieces and finally the metallic grains, meteoric iron, chome or sulfur. All these fragments stay together, but are not bound by any intermediate substance, – one does not find amorphous, glassy, or lava substances." (Mr. Tschermak has, however, found these glassy substances in the Orvinio meteorite (_Mémoires of the Academy of Vienna, Vol. 20_, 1870), and the question can be raised, if the incrustrating substance of the columns, of which we will talk about, is not found in a state of fusion or half-fusion, which appears all the more likely in that it often has a blistered aspect and that it forms inclusions between the crystals. This substance gets deeply into the thinnest interstices, so that it can be thought that it comes solely from the fusion crust.) "It is only in the fusion crust and in the black incrustations similar to the fusion crust and which penetrate into the gaps where we encounter a glassy amorphous substance, but which was generated later during the fall of the meteorite through the atmosphere. The larger granules that are difficult to melt are still usually embedded in this fusion crust without being melted. The mineral splinters display no signs of wear or rolling; they are sharp and pointed angles. The surface of the chondrules is never smooth, as it should be, if these globules were the result of rolling wear; on the contrary, it is uneven, hilly, rough as the surface of a mulberry or cut into crystalloid facets. Many of these chondrules are elongated, with some tapering in a specific direction, as happens with hail. One often encounters pieces which apparently must be regarded as parts of chondrules that have been shattered or torn. Exceptionally, chondrules are seen joined together like twins; more often one sees some on which or in which there are pieces of meteoric iron. Judging from many thin sections, the chondrules are diversely composed. Most often one finds a fibrous structure radiating eccentrically, so that from a point situated in the thinner part and far from the center radiate beams towards the periphery. The cuts directed along the most diverse planes consistently allow one to identify in the radiant substance an arrangement in the columns, needles, leaves or lamellas; it can be concluded that the chondrules are in effect formed by fibrous columns. In correspondence with this point of view, one sees in certain cuts, directed at right angles to the longitudinal fibers, areas irregularly angular and excessively small, as if the whole were composed of small polyhedral granules. Sometimes the chondrules also present an appearance as if they were composed of several systems radiating in different directions. It seems that the center of radiation was changed during its formation, which in certain cuts produces a structure of confused appearance. The fibrous structure becomes obscure towards the place of the periphery where the junction point of the radiating beam is found; here it becomes replaced by a granular agglomeration structure. In none of the many cut chondrules, though they were whole, could I observe that the beams extended all the way to the edge as if their point of meeting was situated outside the globule. The elegantly articulated transverse columns do not, in most cases, extend in the same way throughout the length of the beam; they become more pointed, branch out and terminate to make room for others, so that the cross sections present various designs with reticulated meshes. The columns are composed, as has already been said, of a lighter core and a darker envelope; the first is more or less attackable by acids, while the envelope is more resistant." (Based on my observations, the columns resist the action of boiling aqua regia while a part of the substance serving as an envelope is dissolved by hydrochloric acid alone.) "The enveloping incrustations that as a rule only extend over a small part of the globules and appear to be composed of meteoric iron are very remarkable. The same unilateral incrustations, visible as curved streaks in an arc are also found in the interior of the chondrules and provide strong evidence against the supposition of a genesis of the chondrules through wear of some material. The entire arrangement of the radiating structure of the chondrules speaks moreover in a decisive manner against this supposition. But not all chondrules are eccentrically radiating - many, especially the smaller ones, show a finely granulated structure, as if they were composed of a powdery mass kneaded into a ball. But even in this case the unilateral conformation of the globules is indicated by a more considerable eccentric compression of the powdery particles." (Gümbel l. c. p. [_On the Stone Meteorites Found in Bavaria_] pg. 58)

I wanted this description in its entirety because it corresponds reasonably, except for the points indicated, to my own observations and because it only imparts facts observed without any preconceived opinion and without any other more or less hypothetical explanation. Mr. Gümbel, a consummate mineralogist and geologist, started out with the study of a few meteorites fallen in Bavaria in order to construct generalities which find easy application everywhere.

I should quote here a strange fact. Mr. Gümbel aslo studied the carbonaceous meteorites of Bokkeveld and Kaba. "I was hoping," he says (pg. 71), "that by means of thin sections I could perhaps discover within the carbonaceous mass a trace of organic structure. This mass displays, in the rare areas where it becomes rendered transparent, the membranous or finely granular structure that one encounters elsewhere on similar substances..." "I was not able to discover any indication of organic structure..." He repeats, while talking of the Kaba meteorite: "Also, this carbonaceous meteorite, treated with the method indicated (treatment with potassium chlorate and then with nitric acid), displays no trace of organic structure. Perhaps it will be accomplished eventually by employing the same procedure on larger masses or on other carbonaceous meteorites, the proof of the existence of ogranic beings on celestial bodies outside the Earth." (L. c. p. [_On the Stone Meteorites Found in Bavaria_] pg. 72) 

In his ardor to find partisans, Mr. Hahn cited this phrase in the following manner: "Mr. Gümbel ends with a description of the Kaba meteorite: "Perhaps, however, it is still be possible to prove the existence of organic beings on celestial bodies outside of the Earth." "I hope," adds Mr. Hahn, "that I have succeeded!"

Isn't it strange that Mr. Hahn mentions nothing about the restriction, profoundly wise besides, that Mr. Gümbel places by basing his hopes uniquely on the carbonaceous meteorites?

Now I come to my observations.

In addition to a collection of several hundred fine sections of various rocks formed over a long time, the material at my disposition was lent to me in the most obliging manner by Messrs. de Hochstetter and Brezina (a beautiful entire specimen of Knyahinya), by Mr. Daubrée (artificial peridot and enstatite formed by melting; meteorites from Vouillé and Knyahinya), by Mr. de Marignac (a dozen chondrites of diverse origins), and by Mr. Stanislas Meunier (artificial enstatite glazed). – Not having the intention to provide descriptions of these different meteorites, I will limit myself to that of Knyahinya and secondarily to that of Vouillé, which will furnish sufficient material for the purpose that I propose.

The first question that I have to raise is this: Is the method of research, followed exlusively by Mr. Hahn and his friends, exempt from possible errors?

Negative answer. In effect, the observable structures on living and fossil organisms are preserved even in the thinnest cuts and become quite noticable as the measure of the cut gets very sheer; – in contrast, the structures observed by Mr. Hahn are only visible, regarding the majority of cases, as he says himself, on the semi-transparent cuts and disappear when further work is performed. It was therefore necessary to find out what is supporting this fundamental difference; it was necessary to search, furthermore, if it was not possible to control the results produced by microscopic observation of the thin sheets, by employing alternative methods of exploration.

Be sure to believe that I have not neglected the straightforward inspection of thin sections and that the premier instruments of Leitz, Seibert and Krafft, Verick, and Zeiss have served me in their entire capacity. I would not have mentioned this detail, absolutely insignificant, for everyone nowadays has a good microscope, if it had not been endorsed in a quite distinctive manner within a popular article the excellence of the instrument with which Mr. Hahn makes his observations.

It was not necessary to go far into the examination of the cuts made along the plane of radiation in order to realize that the chondrules were composed, as Gümbel mentions, of small crystalloid columns, often simple as well as ramified, the branches departing, in the latter case, under very acute angles and then gradually dimishing in thickness from the departure point towards the periphery. In the majority of cases, these small columns are perfectly straight, in the others they are slightly curved, Mr. Hahn returns, on a number of occasions in his book, to his response to Mr. Rzehak (_Das Ausland_. No. 26. 1881. pg. 506) regarding the axiom that curved lines may not be found in the mineral kingdom, I provide, in another essay, the figures of a few groups and groups of curved crystals, similar to fronds of certain algae and which may be detected within lava and other crystalline rocks.

These small radiating columns, ramified or not, more or less dense, always display opaque encrustations, visible in the finest cuts and persisting to a large extent despite the action of acids. This encrusting and strongly adherent material fills in all the interstices of the small columns and penetrates the very frequent and often orderly transverse breaks of the small columns in a manner that mimics partition walls. These partition walls are often spaced in a manner so regular that one believes to see, upon considering a single small column, the filaments of algae. One also observes that the opaque encrusting substance is not everywhere of equal thickness; where it appears less opaque one sees roughness, small cavities, even deeper hollows that penetrate into the perfectly clear substance of the small columns, and which are filled by the opaque substance. The transparent substance of the small columns is nearly always rough, almost gnawed away, scarred by thousands of diverse smashes and yet always these cavities and guilloches of encrusted material.

Messrs. Weinland and Hahn are quite insistent, both on the occasional orderly arrangement of these apparent partition walls, and on their nature as partition walls. They are not breaks, they are partition walls; a break forms a simple line, it is "an optical phenomenon"; here, they are "bodily partition walls." I confess that I do not understand the difference between a break, whose two faces are slightly separated and whose gap is filled by an opaque material, and a bodily partition wall. In order to demonstrate that one comes across breaks more or less regularly distanced in crystals which simulate the filaments of algae, I give the figure of similar crystals detected in a thin section of diorite originating from the Leith River, near Edinburgh (Fig. 4). In the majority of cases the edges of these breaks correspond so exactly that one sees only a single line; in the others, more uncommon, one observes two parallel lines; the space is then filled by a clear and limpid vitreous substance. When the infilling substance is slightly opaque, one sees a bodily partition wall with a measurable thickness. I will supply the evidence further on, made through the observation of disaggregated cuts and an analysis of the pieces resulting from the action of acids, that such an effect is the real explanation of the partition walls "being bodily."

A second particularity upon which the designers of the chondrites insist is to rely on the fact that the small columns are truely round tubes, formed by an opaque wall and surrounding a clear substance, a filling of olivine or enstatite. According to them, the opaque encrusting substance would thus be the original skeleton of the animal, whereas the clear substance of the small columns would form the mold for the cavities, previously filled by the soft and shredded substance of the animal.

We pose that in fact any transparent body, whether it is a dodecahedron or an elongated prism with rectilinear facets, _will appear rounded under the microscope due to the transmitted light, where it is surrounded by a more opaque substance._ It is an elementary phenomenon and which is completely accounted for by the disposition of the enveloping substance, which permits a greater amount of light to pass through the middle than at the edges, where it shows more considerable thickness. Shadows gradually decreasing towards a center or line, and gradually increasing towards the edge, gives us the impression of a rounded bulge with curved surfaces. This occurs all the more readily when the facets of the edges come together under blunt angles. Yet, just as massive enstatites display angles so dull that they seem round, likewise the elongated prisms of the enstatites look rounded and completely circular when they are surrounded by a more opaque material like a sheath.

To these difficulties, inherent in the nature of these objects, is added another. Inside the majority of the chondrules, the little columns are so confined and thin that it becomes physically impossible to make a cut that has a depth of only a single small column. All the cuts, even the thinnest, consequently contain quite a few superimposed layers of small columns. One can easily imagine that these superimposed bodies, transparent, although encrusted by an opaque material, and whose edges do not correspond in their layering, will necessarily produce fallacious and most of the time indecipherable shadow effects. An opaque interstice between two subjacent small columns, located within the median axis of the small column identified in the focus of the microscope lens, will impart to this small column an appearance like it was pierced by a longitudinal channel; partitions situated a little obliquely with respect to the axis of the small column, in between which are located the shadows produced by the subjacent partitions, will give to the small column the demeanor of being arrayed in a string. Even with the greatest volition in the world and despite the employment of superior instruments, all these difficulties cannot be vanquished; I would even state that the more one is trained in microscopic observation, the more one is persuaded that certitudes may not be acquired.

I have assayed polarized light, whose application should never be omitted when dealing with the analysis of minerals or rocks; the results were not conclusive enough to eliminate all the doubts. I will disclose these results later in their entirety.

Mr. Hahn sees the entire mass of the chondrites composed of organisms; Mr. Weinland sees only two-thirds of it; Mr. Rzehak (_Das Ausland_, No. 26, 1881) does not see any at all, and examining everything, I had to align myself with the view of the latter observer.

It was therefore necessary to search for alternative methods and other comparisons.

Mr. Gümbel had already indicated the pathway. He always was concerned with verifying his observations on thin sections with microchemical operations. Referring to the Mauerkirchen meteorite (Nov. 20, 1768), he says (pg. 19): "After having treated the finely crushed (not pulverized) with aqua regia and caustic potash, I saw that the metallic parts and the yellowish splinters (olivine) had disappeared and that the residue consisted of white or brownish fragments which were easily distinguished under the microscope.
