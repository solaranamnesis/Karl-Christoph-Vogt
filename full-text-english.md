Towards the end of 1880 there appeared in Germany a work in four parts, which could not fail to arouse one's attention. It was entitled: _The Meteorite (Chondrite) and its Organisms_, presented and described by Otto Hahn, doctor. Thirty-two tables with a hundred and forty-two pictures photographed. Tübingen, 1880. Laupp, publisher.

I summarize, by literally translating the author's words, the main results he lays down.

"The chondrites, an olivine-feldspar (enstatite) rock, consist of an animal world, they are not part of a sedimentary rock layer nor a conglomerate, but a felt of animals, a fabric whose meshes were all once living beings and life of the lowest kind, the beginnings of creation." (p. 3.)

"As one examines the tables of this work, it immediately becomes clear that these are not mineral forms, but organic ones; that we have before us the images of life, images of life of the lowest order, a creation which in greater part finds some of its closest relatives here on Earth — regarding the corals and crinoids, this is determined with absolute certainty; however, the sponges have only a little similarity with those forms of the terrestrial genera." (p. 7.)

"Anyone who even superficially surveys the forms will soon find that they provide an actual historical development. All the transitions from the sponge to the coral, from the coral to the crinoid are present, so that it becomes doubtful if one should assign new species to these transitions." (p. 3.)

"The investigations up till now, in the whole field, with the exception of [Karl Wilhelm von] Gümbel's work in the Munich Academy, are of little use, both regarding the accuracy of their observations and even more the interpretations based upon those observations, i.e. on unproven hypotheses and weak assumptions — not suitable for scientific findings as such." (p. 7.)

Hahn therefore believes that he has provided "incontestable proof that the chondrites are the remains of animals that lived in water, that the entire meteorite is formed only of the remains of sponges, corals, and crinoids, metamorphosed by petrification into enstatite. It is true, he says, that there are small rare places where there are real crystals, but these crystals are so disposed that they cannot have any influence on the value of my actual proofs." (p. 21.)

"When I said that the chondrite is nothing but an animal-fabric, an animal-felt, a qualification must be sustained."

"There are, however, very small, sharply outlined places in this animal-bone stone, which could probably (but not necessarily) be from the beginning rocks. These are slate-blue, uncommon inclusions with 3-5 mm. diameters _lacking definite recurring forms_, which include distinct crystals in their grayish mass, these are on average either squares or rhombuses, at other times it includes hexagons. This mineral can be either augite or olivine. It does not knock on the fact, _that in the olivine strata formations exist and that these are the cause of the construction of the planet bodies, their self-constructed development and complex composition_."

"In all cases, however, the ratio in the chondritic rock is the opposite as that in the sedimentary layers of Earth. In the latter the organisms are stored and the rock strata enclose them; in the first there are only organisms and the rock strata are masses of such." (p. 35.)

"These forms are not mineral forms," says Mr. Hahn with absolute certainty. But knowing very well that similar such assertions are rarely accepted by the scientific world, without palpable proofs, he seeks to give them by grouping them into two categories, stating positive proofs and negative proofs.

"In order to prove that a plant or animal organism is present, I consider it necessary to prove:  
1. a determinate form, (I do not know how to translate the term used several times by Mr. Hahn, "geschlossene Form"; the literal translation, "closed form" has no meaning)  
2. a form that repeats,  
3. one which repeats itself in degrees of development,  
4. structure, namely cells or vessels,  
5. resemblance to known forms."  

"If these requirements are valid, it remains only to decide whether plant or animal? Now ask yourself, do my forms fulfill these requirements?" (p. 20.)

Needless to say, the response is affirmative.

Of all these conditions laid out by Mr. Hahn, there are obviously only two that can decide the question from certain points of view; the others are equally applicable to minerals. Crystals have determinate forms, which always repeat themselves and always better than organic forms, in the various phases of development. Until now we were quite convinced that it was a privilege of the great number of organic types to change form during the different phases of their development; apart from spawn, germs and seeds, and larval forms, for example, which are often very different from those of definitive animals, and the cotyledons of plants, which often do not resemble definitive leaves in any way, crystal forms are extremely stable. Mr. Hahn maintains that we are in error. Granted, – only, in this case, the first three conditions he poses do not say anything about the distinction between organic and inorganic forms.

The structure that Mr. Hahn invokes as the fourth condition is without a doubt preponderant, provided however that the animal or plant parts subject to the petrification persist. Hahn poses as a condition of this structure the presence of cells or vessels. That's very well, – but I'd like to know, what cells and vessels could remain when a sponge undergoes fossilization? It is known that the tissues of these animals are composed of extremely delicate cells, which dissolve with great ease, and all that can be found in a petrified sponge consists of calcareous or siliceous mineral spicules, in which neither cells nor vessels can be seen! And if the presence of cells or vessels is an indispensable feature, what is to become of fossil corals, where one definitely sees only lacuna surrounded by crystals?

All that remains of the five conditions posed by Mr. Hahn is that last, the similarity with known forms. But here again the greatest uncertainties can take place. Are these the exterior forms? Are these the details of the structure of the forms? We mention, in another essay, a host of cases where prominent mineral conformations, produced artificially or by nature, mimic in a perfect manner organic forms and we have, on the other hand, in the corals, in the intracellular crystals of plants, in the otoliths of animals, a quantity of examples of mineral forms produced by organisms.

We must therefore address the forms and special comparative structures. We must push the comparison to the most minor details in appearance when we want to prove that this object which we have before our eyes is a sponge, a coral, or a crinoid. We leave aside, for the moment, the so-called negative proofs by which the author wants to demonstrate to us that the objects displayed by him cannot be mineral forms – they are of about the same value as his positive proofs. We address the special forms, which by their resemblance to known forms and by their identical structure have to provide incontestable proof that the chondrites are formed by organisms related to those of the Earth.

We sequentially give a review on these claimed organisms by enumerating, with the same terms of the work, the aspects that the author attributes to different organisms which he believes to have recognized. 

"A. Sponges"

"1\. _Urania_"

"Round, lobed bodies with an obvious place of growth." – "Folds caused by contraction." – "Circumvented spiral." – "The structure consists of an outer membrane enclosing lamellar layers." – "Blue color." – "Obvious stratification. One might attempt to place the form among the corals if the outer form did not exist." – "We believe to see the indication of a mouth opening."

"After all this, I think _Urania_ is a sessile sponge that contracts in a spiral form, absorbing and expelling water like our living sponges." (p. 23 and 24.)

These are the structural details that must convert us to the opinion of Mr. Hahn. The _Urania_ fill, according to him, three twentieths of the total mass of the stony meteorites; they are displayed on six tables comprising thirty-one figures.

In a previous work by the same author, _The Primordial Cell_, _Urania guilielmi_, dedicated to Emperor William [I], was represented as a plant with rounded leaves, wrapped up in its young age and equipped with capsules carrying spores. In passing through the present work, _Urania_ lost these capsules with their spores; it became a sponge. It is true that we are not allowed to learn of the point causing this change of place, so considerable, to occur; the author does not say a word about the reasons which obliged him to change his opinion. What aspects of this supposed organism were lost or gained to be transported from one kingdom to another? An inopportune question that the author does not answer.

"2\. Sponges with spicules." (Table 7.)

"I place Figure 1 among the _Astrospongia_. The spicules are regularly crossed. Figure 6 is an irregular spicule framework with a weakly indicated cavity." (p. 24.)

The supposed spicules resemble, mistakenly, linear crystals dispersed in a homogeneous mass, such as seen in the initial coming of lava. In a few places we see a slightly marked tendency towards a stellar arrangement, very common in crystals, unusual in the spicules of sponges, whose forms are known to be quite different (1).

The author could not have compared his _Urania_ and astro-sponges with living and fossil sponges; he could not have studied the structure of the latter, for it would be impossible with this acquired knowledge to convince connoisseurs, as the notions and figures given by him have little rapport with the microscopic structure and nature of sponges. Mr. Hahn must be entirely ignorant of the fine research of Mr. Zittel on fossil sponges. (_Memoirs of the Munich Academy_, Vol. 12 and 13; _Handbook of Paleontology_, Vol. 1), because with this knowledge he could not have presented to us, as obvious sponges, cross-sections with rounded contours surrounded by a membrane [sic!] possessing a structure or fine striations or lamella, equally unknown in living and fossil sponges. We know, it is true, of a quantity of fossil sponges where the layout of the channels displays a radiating arrangement, already visible to the naked eye or the magnifying glass (_Aulocopium_, the Ventriculitides); but in all these sponges the spicules, being either loose or forming a very regular reticulated skeletal mesh, are always recognizable in the magnifications used by Mr. Hahn. In the claimed sponges of the meteorites there does not exist any trace whatsoever of this characteristic skeleton. We also know from Mr. Zittel's research the conditions under which, by the pseudomorphosis of siliceous sponges in limestone and that of calcareous sponges in silica, the inner structure may be entirely of partly lost; but in these cases the indication
