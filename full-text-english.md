Towards the end of 1880 there appeared in Germany a work in four parts, which could not fail to arouse one's attention. It was entitled: _The Meteorite (Chondrite) and its Organisms_, presented and described by Otto Hahn, Doctor. Thirty-two tables with a hundred and forty-two pictures photographed. Tübingen, 1880. Laupp, publisher.

I summarize, by literally translating the author's words, the main results he lays down.

"The chondrites, an olivine-feldspar (enstatite) rock, consist of an animal world, they are not part of a sedimentary rock layer nor a conglomerate, but a felt of animals, a fabric whose meshes were all once living beings and life of the lowest kind, the beginnings of creation." (p. 3)

"As one examines the tables of this work, it immediately becomes clear that these are not mineral forms, but organic ones; that we have before us the images of life, images of life of the lowest order, a creation which in greater part finds some of its closest relatives here on Earth — regarding the corals and crinoids, this is determined with absolute certainty; however, the sponges have only a little similarity with those forms of the terrestrial genera." (p. 7)

"Anyone who even superficially surveys the forms will soon find that they provide an actual historical development. All the transitions from the sponge to the coral, from the coral to the crinoid are present, so that it becomes doubtful if one should assign new species to these transitions." (p. 3)

"The investigations up till now, in the whole field, with the exception of [Karl Wilhelm von] Gümbel's work in the Munich Academy, are of little use, both regarding their accuracy of observation and even more as regards their interpretations based upon those observations, i.e. on unproven hypotheses and weak assumptions — not suitable for scientific findings as such."
